Celestial pole motion
=====================
This is a wee graphical application to **visualise the movement of the celestial pole** (J2000.0) with respect to the ICRS due to the precession and nutation of the Earth. There is a **basic GUI** which lets you switch between **north** and **south** pole and lets you control the time speed. The program uses the IAU2000 equations for the two sets of angles and yields good results for at least a span of 6000 years. It also features the latitude lines and a background with some of the most important Hipparcos stars.
